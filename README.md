```

### State Management

The app uses **Provider** for state management with the following providers:

- **DrawingState**: Manages canvas state, tools, and strokes
- **ColorState**: Handles color palette and selection
- **GalleryState**: Manages artwork collections and filtering

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Model validation and serialization
- Business logic and calculations
- Utility functions and helpers

#### Widget Tests  
- UI component behavior
- User interaction flows
- Widget rendering and layout

#### Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflows
- Cross-feature interactions
- Performance testing

#### Performance Tests
- Drawing operation efficiency
- Memory usage optimization
- Large dataset handling

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test categories
flutter test test/unit/
flutter test test/widget/
flutter test integration_test/

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```
