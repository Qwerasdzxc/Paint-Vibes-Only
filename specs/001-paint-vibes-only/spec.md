## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a creative user, I want to use a fun and intuitive drawing app where I can create digital artwork using various tools and colors, save my creations, and also enjoy coloring pre-made designs, so that I can express my creativity and have an enjoyable artistic experience on my mobile device.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I open the app, **When** I start drawing on the canvas with a brush tool and selected color, **Then** I should see my strokes appear on the canvas in real-time
2. **Given** I have drawn something on the canvas, **When** I tap the undo button, **Then** my last stroke should be removed from the canvas
3. **Given** I have created a drawing, **When** I tap the save option, **Then** my artwork should be saved and accessible later
4. **Given** I want to change colors, **When** I select a different color from the palette, **Then** my next strokes should use the new color
5. **Given** I want to start fresh, **When** I tap the clear canvas option, **Then** the canvas should become completely blank
6. **Given** I'm in coloring mode, **When** I select a coloring page and apply colors, **Then** my progress should be saved for that specific page
7. **Given** I have saved drawings, **When** I access the gallery, **Then** I should see all my previous creations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when device storage is full during save operation?
- How does the system handle rapid consecutive undo/redo operations?
- What occurs when user tries to save an empty canvas?
- How does the app behave when switching between drawing modes quickly?
- What happens to unsaved work when user navigates away from drawing screen?
